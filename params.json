  "body": "### What is this?  \r\nxkcd-generate creates pass phrases from novels and dictionaries, with options to add digits or special characters.  \r\n\r\n### What drove this?  \r\nThere's no way I can sum it up better than the now classic [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/936/) comic describing the problem with passwords.  Go look at it now.  I'll wait.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I wanted another playground for experimenting with Perl's Gtk3 libraries.  If you'd like to see lots of example perl-Gtk3 programs, I wrote some [here](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/gtk3-perl-demos) you can check out.  \r\n\r\n### Did you implement this in a really, really secure manner?  \r\nI'm not sure.  Give it a shot.  \r\n\r\n### How can I install this?  \r\nThe easiest way is to use the prebuilt binaries.  All rpms and debs are digitally signed, and you can check the tarball's sig as well.  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors  \r\nSo far, just me (@dave-theunsub).  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact  \r\nHaving trouble with this?
